## Course Outline

### 1. Introduction to Python

Before diving into data science, we’ll cover the basics of Python. You’ll learn the fundamentals of programming, including how to write Python scripts, work with data types, and use loops and functions.

Key concepts:
- Python syntax and structure
- Variables and data types (strings, integers, floats, booleans)
- Conditional statements (if, else, elif)
- Loops (for, while)
- Functions

Resources:
- [Python Documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html)
- [Learn Python in 10 minutes](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_intro.asp)

### 2. Working with Data

Data science is all about working with data. In this section, you’ll learn to use the **Pandas** and **NumPy** libraries to load, clean, and manipulate datasets.

Key concepts:
- Data structures (lists, dictionaries, sets, tuples)
- **Pandas**: Series and DataFrame objects
- Cleaning and transforming data (handling missing values, duplicates)
- Sorting and filtering data
- Importing/exporting data (CSV, Excel)

Resources:
- [Pandas Documentation](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/)
- [NumPy Documentation](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/)
- [Data Cleaning with Pandas](https://realpython.com/pandas-dataframe/)

### 3. Data Visualization

Visualizing data helps you understand the patterns and insights hidden in your data. In this section, you’ll learn how to create powerful visualizations using **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**.

Key concepts:
- Introduction to **Matplotlib** (line charts, bar charts, histograms)
- Customizing plots (titles, labels, colors)
- **Seaborn**: Statistical plots like pair plots and heatmaps

### 4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

EDA is an important step in any data science project. This section will teach you how to explore and analyze your data to uncover insights and patterns.

Key concepts:
- Summary statistics (mean, median, mode, standard deviation)
- Visualizing distributions (histograms, boxplots)
- Correlation analysis (scatterplots, correlation matrix)
- Identifying and handling outliers

### 5. Statistical Analysis

Statistics is a critical part of data science. In this section, you’ll learn the basics of statistical analysis, including hypothesis testing, probability distributions, and confidence intervals.

Key concepts:
- Descriptive statistics (mean, median, variance)
- Probability distributions (normal, binomial, Poisson)
- Hypothesis testing (t-tests, chi-square tests)
- Confidence intervals

- [Hypothesis Testing in Python](https://realpython.com/hypothesis-testing-python/)

### 6. Machine Learning Basics

Machine learning is one of the most exciting aspects of data science. In this section, we’ll cover the basics of building machine learning models using the **Scikit-learn** library.

Key concepts:
- Supervised vs. Unsupervised learning
- **Linear Regression**: Predicting continuous values
- **Logistic Regression**: Classification (binary outcomes)
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**: Classification and regression
- **K-Means Clustering**: Grouping data points

Resources:
- [Scikit-learn Documentation](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/)
- [Machine Learning with Python](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/machine-learning-with-python)

### 7. Advanced Machine Learning

Once you’ve learned the basics of machine learning, this section will take you deeper into more advanced techniques, including decision trees, random forests, support vector machines, and neural networks.

Key concepts:
- **Decision Trees**: A tree-based learning algorithm
- **Random Forests**: Ensemble learning with decision trees
- **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**: Classification with hyperplanes
- **Neural Networks**: Introduction to deep learning
